<H1>Mycena</H1>
  <p>Small, white-spored, saprophytic little mushrooms that often can be found growing in clusters. Sometimes brightly colored and easy to ID, but often brown or gray and quite unnassuming</p>
<p><a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=any&verifiable=any&field:Provisional%20Species%20Name=Mycena%20%22sp-IN10%22"><Strong>Mycena "sp-IN10"</Strong></a> - This is one of the most common Mycena species encountered in our area. In a broad sense, this goes under M. galericulata but it does not closely match European sequences of M. galericulata and probably needs its own name (see Michael Kuo of Mushroom Expert's commentary on the M. galericulata and M. inclinata in the states <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/mycena_inclinata.html">here</a>.)</p>
  <p>These guys are quite variable, with bell shaped caps, usually with a small central bump. They start out dark brown and usually fade to a greyish-brown to yellowish-brown with age, with a darker center and a paler margin. The odor can sometimes, but not always, be slightly mealy. They can grown in clusters or scattered, and can be found abundandly on well-decayed logs.</p>
