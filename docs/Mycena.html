<H1>Mycena</H1>
  <p>Small, white-spored, saprophytic little mushrooms that often can be found growing in clusters. Sometimes brightly colored and easy to ID, but often brown or gray and quite unnassuming</p>
<p><a href="20Namehttps://www.inaturalist.org/observations?verifiable=any&place_id=any&field:Provisional%20Species%20Name=Mycena%20PNW10"><strong>Mycena PNW10</strong></a> - Widespread and quite variable in ITS, this group of sequences has been found in both the west coast and the midwest. Color varies from gray to tan to almost white. More details can be found <a href="https://alpental.com/psms/ddd/Mycenaceae/index.htm">on Danny Miller's PNW project page</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=any&verifiable=any&field:Provisional%20Species%20Name=Mycena%20%22sp-IN10%22"><Strong>Mycena "sp-IN10"</Strong></a> - This is one of the most common Mycena species encountered in our area. In a broad sense, this goes under M. galericulata but it does not closely match European sequences of M. galericulata and probably needs its own name (see Michael Kuo of Mushroom Expert's commentary on the M. galericulata and M. inclinata in the states <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/mycena_inclinata.html">here</a>.)</p>
  <p>These guys are quite variable, with bell-shaped caps, usually with a small central bump. They start out dark brown and usually fade to a greyish-brown to yellowish-brown with age, with a darker center and a paler margin. The odor can sometimes, but not always, be slightly mealy. They can grown in clusters or scattered, and can be found abundantly on well-decayed hardwood logs.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?verifiable=any&place_id=any&field:Provisional%20Species%20Name=Mycena%20%22inclinata-IN01%22"><Strong>Mycena "inclinata-IN01"</Strong></a> - This is the other extremely common Mycena species in our area. Similar to "sp-IN10", it is broadly known under the name M. inclinata, but the sequences are not a close match for European sequences, and this probably deserves its own name. These tend to grow with a very gregariously clustered habit, though it is possible to find them singly or scattered. The bell-shaped, usually ubonate, caps begin brown or grayish-brown and usually fade with age. The stipe when fresh fade from yellow near the cap to an orangish-brown near the base, and yellow staining and brown marks may be present on the cap; yellow marks fluoresce green under UV. The odor on these when fresh is usually strongly mealy, farinaceous, even foul. Saprophytic on well-decayed hardwood logs</p>

<p><a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=any&taxon_id=63450&verifiable=any&field:DNA%20Barcode%20ITS="><strong>Mycena vitilis</strong> - This is a widespread species with American sequences matching European sequences. Tan to gray and fading with age, they have a long, thin stipes that tend to grow on buried detritus.</p>
