<h1>Russula</h1>
<p>Ah, Russula. Everyone's favorite difficult-to-id, variable, brittle, and sometimes spicy genus of mycorrhizal fungi. Thanks to a combination of factors, these guys can be nearly impossible to get to a known species in the eastern US, even with sequences. Bart Buyck, a leading French Russula expert, put out a paper in 2007 titled <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312040582_A_new_initiative_toward_the_study_of_Russula_in_the_eastern_United_States_Pagine_di_Micologia_27_81-86">'A new initiative toward the study of Russula in the eastern United States'</a> that brings light to some of the issues. Despite being over a decade old, it offers some good insight into why the understanding of the genus in our region became so convoluted.</p>
<p>There are a plethora of temp codes here; hopefully sequences types will help demystify some of these shrooms.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=any&amp;taxon_id=126178&amp;verifiable=any&amp;field:DNA%20Barcode%20ITS="><strong>Russula parvovirescens</strong></a> - Formerly known under the temp code Russula &quot;IN-30&quot;, this species was determined after Professor Buyck was kind enough to provide us with the sequence to his holotype. The species is a smaller species, with a cap diameter usually less than 7cm, a cap colored blue-green to gray-green, with scaley patches on the cap surface that may discolor pale to dark brown. The spore print should be cream colored and mature specimans will have a distinctly striate margin.</p>
