<h1>Russula</h1>
  <p>Ah, Russula. Everyone's favorite difficult-to-id, variable, brittle, and sometimes spicy genus of mycorrhizal fungi. Thanks to a combination of factors, these guys can be nearly impossible to get to a known species in the eastern US, even with sequences. Bart Buyck, a leading French Russula expert, put out a paper in 2007 titled <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312040582_A_new_initiative_toward_the_study_of_Russula_in_the_eastern_United_States_Pagine_di_Micologia_27_81-86">'A new initiative toward the study of Russula in the eastern United States'</a> that brings light to some of the issues. Despite being over a decade old, it offers some good insight into why the understanding of the genus in our region became so convoluted.</p>
  <p>There are a plethora of temp codes here; hopefully sequenced types will help demystify some of these shrooms.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=any&taxon_id=966598&verifiable=any&field:DNA%20Barcode%20ITS="><strong>Russula cremeirosea</strong></a> - A small, delicate looking russula. Red to vinaceous cap that fades from the margin inward in maturity; partially peeling cap, mild taste, no odor. Cream colored gills have small amount of forking near stipe.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=any&taxon_id=1283447&verifiable=any&field:DNA%20Barcode%20ITS="><strong>Russula katarinae</strong></a> - This is a small Russula, with a cap diameter generally less than 6cm. The cap coloration can range from orange, to orange-yellow or pale yellow, with a cap cuticle that peels to about 3/4 of the cap radius. The stipe is white and may be wider at the base than the top and stains brownish when bruised or cut. Gills are densely packed with some forking near the stipe, with an adnate to adnexed attachment. Mild tasting, with a fishy odor at maturity and a cream to ochre spore print.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=any&amp;taxon_id=126178&amp;verifiable=any&amp;field:DNA%20Barcode%20ITS="><strong>Russula parvovirescens</strong></a> - Formerly known under the temp code Russula &quot;IN-30&quot;, this species was determined after Professor Buyck was kind enough to provide us with the sequence to his holotype. The species is a smaller species, with a cap diameter usually less than 7cm, a cap colored blue-green to gray-green, with scaley patches on the cap surface that may discolor pale to dark brown. The spore print should be cream colored and mature specimans will have a distinctly striate margin.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=any&verifiable=any&field:Provisional%20Species%20Name=Russula%20%22sp-IN6%22"><strong>Russula "sp-IN6"</strong></a> - Specimans under this code exhibit a fairly consistent buff or tawny cap & stem coloration; the cap surface seems to develop scattered cracks in age, and the stem color fades in older specimans, with the colored surface separating into small patches of color. The gills have some forking near the stipe, and lamellulae are present</p>

<p><a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?verifiable=any&place_id=any&field:Provisional%20Species%20Name=Russula%20%22sp-OH05%22"><strong>Russula "sp-OH05"</strong></a> - As of this writing, only known from a single specimen, but it seems to be closely related to the west coast R. pseudotsugarum. Conifer-associated, red-capped with a striate, paler margin. White stipe. Brittle gills are spaced close but not crowded, lacking in lamellulae and forks</p>
