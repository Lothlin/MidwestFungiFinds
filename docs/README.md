# Welcome to Midwest Fungi Finds!

This site is intended to help document the species sequenced by the [Ohio Mushroom DNA Lab](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/ohio-fungi-with-dna-sequence-data-ohio-mycoflora-project) and other sequencing projects throughout North America. Primarily, our focus is on Ohio but you will see representations of species found in other states more collections are made and sequenced from those areas.

This site is not intended to be a comprehensive identification source or an authority on what mushrooms are edible or poisonous in an area - if you are looking for that information, there are better resources out there. Instead, this is meant as a complement to [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/home) and [Mycomap](https://www.mycomap.com), primarily to help demystify temp codes applied to sequences, but also to help catalogue what described species have been genetically shown to be present in which state.

This is a work in progress, so bear with me! I'll do my best to keep it updated, but things may slip through the cracks.
