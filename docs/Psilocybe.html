<H1>Psilocybe</H1>
  <p>Blue staining. Purple-spored. Psychadelic. Therapeutic. Sometimes likes wood, sometimes like dung - either way, they're decomposers. There aren't as many Psilocybe species in the midwest as there are in some more tropical areas, but we do still have some present.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=any&taxon_id=348835&verifiable=any&field:DNA%20Barcode%20ITS="><strong>Psilocybe ovoideocystidiata</strong></a> - Say this name three times fast. Ovoids are a relatively large psilocybe that fruits gregariously on woodchips throughout the east; it is especially common in the Ohio river valley. Chestnut brown to yellowish brown to even creamy pale, mature specimans tend to bruise blue or greenish and old specimans may be almost black in color.</p>
