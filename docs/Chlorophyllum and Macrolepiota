<h1>Chlorophyllum</h1>
  <p>Chlorophyllum; the often disappointing thing you find when you're actually looking for delicious Macrolepiota. Push that disappointment aside and appreciate these statuesque parasols for the impressive mushrooms they are. Generally, the easiest way to tell you have Chlorophyllum and not Macrolepiota is to look at the stem texture; Chlorophyllum will have a smooth stem, whereas Macrolepiota have a layer of tissue on the stipe that breaks up into a chevron/snakeskin looking pattern.</p>
