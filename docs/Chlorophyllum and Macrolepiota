<h1>Chlorophyllum</h1>
  <p>Chlorophyllum; the often disappointing thing you find when you're actually looking for delicious Macrolepiota. Push that disappointment aside and appreciate these statuesque parasols for the impressive mushrooms they are. Generally, the easiest way to tell you have Chlorophyllum and not Macrolepiota is to look at the stem texture; Chlorophyllum will have a smooth stem, whereas Macrolepiota have a layer of tissue on the stipe that breaks up into a chevron/snakeskin looking pattern.</p>
<h1>Macrolepiota</h1>
  <p>There are various species of Macrolepiota in the Americas, none of which are Macrolepiota procera, despite looking very similar. Field guides are likely to continue calling our species M. procera for the foreseeable future, but in the meantime, we at least have current publications to reference! Our two eastern/midwestern species mentioned here are recently described and the open-source paper is filed under doi.org/10.3114/fuse.2024.14.09 and can be found <a href="https://fuse-journal.org/">here</a>. There is an additional, rare species in the Pacific Northwest that remains undescribed, another that has been found in Arizona, along with several central and south American species</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=any&taxon_id=1550317&verifiable=any&field:DNA%20Barcode%20ITS=">Macrolepiota macilenta</a> - Technically, we don't have any sequences of this species yet from Ohio, but given the range of this species, it is most certainly present here. In brief, this is an attractive parasol that tends towards brown tones, but can occasionally be found with a cream-colored cap. Other important identification characteristics of Macrolepiota in general include a moveable, double-sided ring on the stipe, the abovementioned snakeskin pattern on the stipe, a white spore print, and a cap that breaks up into a scaley texture interspersed with fine fibrils.</p>
